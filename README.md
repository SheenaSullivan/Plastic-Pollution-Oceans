# How much plastic waste is in our oceans?
by Sheena Sullivan

### About

This project will document the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans and the largest contributors and will answer the following questions:

 1. Which countries produce the most plastic waste? 
 2. Which rivers emit the most plastics to the oceans. 
 3. Which countries emit the most plastic to the ocean. 
 4. Which oceans have the most plastic waste? and 
 5. Where does all the plastic waste accumulate in the ocean? 
 
The project will take data from several CSV files and plot the increasing levels of plastics in the ocean and the largest contributing countries.

This is a project for Code Kentucky's Data Analysis Course 1.
