# How much plastic waste is in our oceans?
by Sheena Sullivan

### About

Plastic waste is increasing at an alarming rate and impacting our environment. We must seek alternative to plastic usage and save our oceans and marine wildlife.

This project will document the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans and the largest contributors and will answer the following questions:

 1. Which countries produce the most plastic waste? 
 2. Which rivers emit the most plastics to the oceans. 
 3. Which countries emit the most plastic to the ocean. 
 4. Which oceans have the most plastic waste? 
 5. How does this impact marine wildlife?

 
The project will take data from several CSV files and plot the increasing levels of plastics in the ocean and the largest contributing countries.

This is a project for Code Kentucky's Data Analysis Course 1.
 

**Spreadsheets** 
The `assets` folder contains the CSVs uploaded from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org). Also included is an Excel spreadsheet with data gathered from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X19310148?via%3Dihub.

## Running the Program

Python 3 is required. To download the current version, please [click here](https://www.python.org).  All scripts were written using version 3.10.64.

1. Download or clone the project from GitHub [here](https://github.com/SheenaSullivan/Plastic-Pollution-Oceans.git). 

2. Optional: Install a virtual environment. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

3. Install the requirements from the `Plastic-Pollution-Oceans` folder. 

     To install required packages from the `requirements.txt` run  `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 

    The following packages will be required to run the program: 
        pandas, 
        numby, 
        matplotlib.pyplot, 
        seaborn, 
        plotly.express, 
        basemap, 
        IPython.
